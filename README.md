Python machine learning models<br/>
I have featured both supervised and unsupervised models to tackle a problem.
<br/>
Included is the dataset to predict whether an instution is private or public based on its features.

In this repository I'll be doing the basic machine learning models available in sklearn <br/>
Featured models include:<br/>
(supervised models)<br/>
Random forests,<br/>
Logistic regression,<br/>
(unsupervised models)<br/>
Hierachical classification,<br/>
Kmeans.<br/>

Basic data cleaning in Pandas is also featured.
